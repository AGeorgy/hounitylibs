**Pay attention, this is a pre-alpha version**. Everything works, but some parts are not yet fully documented, and the APIs might change.

As of now, HOUnityLibs is composed of 4 projects, each of which generates a separate and independent assembly (you can find the compiled files inside each bin directory, and a little more info [here](Usage.md)):
  * **HOEditorGUIFramework**: various utilities and styles useful when creating editor panels/windows GUIs. Uses a different approach to layout the GUI, which is less prone to user errors and more readable. Also contains HOEditorUndoManager, which can be used to allow a clean and functional undo management.
  * **HOEditorUtils**: various file and asset utils.
  * **HODebugFramework**: debug components and utils.
  * **HO2DToolkit**: framework for [Unikron's 2D Toolkit](http://www.unikronsoftware.com/2dtoolkit/)
